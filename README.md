The project consists of a multi-page e-commerce website built with Next.js, using a local data.json file for its products.

Users are able to:

- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
- Shipping always adds $50 to the order
- VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## üìå What did I learn?

This was an excellent opportunity to develop componentization and the use of Next.js's routing system, with the goal of enabling better management of the many pages that make up the application, as well as passing parameters between routes.
